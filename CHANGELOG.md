## Version 1.2.1 - February 3, 2013
- Fixed several more threading issues as related to UI lagginess. 

## Version 1.2 - February 1, 2013
- Fixed tricky threading bugs in the delayedStartLocationProvider() and delayedStartCachedLocationProviders() methods. Previous construction might have been causing crashes when the application restarted after being idle and minimized for some time period.

## Version 1.1 - January 30, 2013

- Fixed a fatal bug related to the network location provider returning a null value. All null values related to both the location providers (GPS and Network) should be properly trapped now. This condition can manifest in a number of different ways such as under device Location Services the Google Location Service option is disabled. And second some cellular carriers do not provide this service.


## Version 1.0 - January 21, 2013

- Supports Androids v3.0+ because of use of UI fragments.
